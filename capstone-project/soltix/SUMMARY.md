# Soltix Project Summary

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Event Creation Functionality**

   - Successfully tested event creation on devnet
   - Verified that events and whitelist accounts are correctly initialized
   - Confirmed that event data is stored correctly

2. **Code Improvements**

   - Fixed linter errors in the whitelist.rs and mint_ticket.rs files
   - Updated error handling in both files to use a more explicit approach
   - Improved the test suite to focus on working functionality

3. **Documentation**

   - Created a comprehensive README.md with project information
   - Documented known issues and next steps
   - Created a detailed plan for fixing the whitelist and mint ticket functionality

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up testing against devnet
   - Created a test script for easy execution
   - Configured the Solana CLI to use devnet

## Current Status

1. **Working Features**

   - Event creation with multiple ticket tiers
   - Whitelist account initialization during event creation

2. **Issues**
   - Whitelist functionality: The deployed program is trying to initialize the whitelist account again during the AddToWhitelist instruction
   - Deployment: Unable to deploy the updated program to devnet due to transaction failures
   - Mint ticket functionality: Not yet tested due to issues with the whitelist functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Deployment Strategy**

   - Try deploying during off-peak hours when the network is less congested
   - Consider using a different RPC endpoint for deployment
   - If deployment continues to fail, consider creating a new program ID

2. **Whitelist Functionality**

   - Once deployment is successful, test the whitelist functionality with the updated program
   - If issues persist, consider modifying the AddToWhitelist context to handle existing accounts

3. **Mint Ticket Functionality**
   - After resolving whitelist issues, implement and test the mint ticket functionality
   - Update the token program references to use the correct program ID

## Future Enhancements

1. **Metadata Support**

   - Implement metadata creation for NFT tickets
   - Add support for custom metadata attributes

2. **Frontend Development**

   - Create a web frontend for interacting with the program
   - Implement user-friendly interfaces for event creation, whitelist management, and ticket minting

3. **Security Enhancements**

   - Add more comprehensive validation and error handling
   - Implement additional security measures to protect against potential exploits

4. **Additional Features**
   - Support for ticket transfers
   - Secondary market functionality
   - Event management tools for organizers
